- This is a simple circuit mainly for mixing GATE/TRIGGER.
- It is 8in and 1out.
- P&P file and BOM are included so that you can use SMT assembly with JLCPCB etc.
- I use a 3.5mm stereo jack called PJ311. Unnecessary pins for stereo are floated.
- If you need a large quantity, you can purchase it from [Aliepress under the part number PJ342.](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/4000661854237.html))
