# Passive_modules
This is a passive outboard device for modular synths and can be used a "bare"PCB.
It can be produced by submitting the Gerber file for PCB to a production company in China.
- - Some of the products are Eurorack-standard.

## DiodeORLogic

- This is a simple circuit mainly for mixing GATE/TRIGGER.
- It is 8in and 1out.
- P&P file and BOM are included so that you can use SMT assembly with JLCPCB etc.
- I use a 3.5mm stereo jack called PJ311. Unnecessary pins for stereo are floated. If you need a large quantity, you can purchase it from [Aliexpress under the part number PJ342.](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/4000661854237.html)
- It has actually been manufactured and is working well.

## 2hp switched multiple
- This is actually inspired by the Switched Multiple in "Extralife".[MUST BE WATCH](https://youtu.be/l3i5O9jBNbY)
- This is data for Eurorack format panels only; when submitting to PCB Fab, it is recommended that they be manufactured in aluminum sheet.
- EASY!

## micro passive multiple
- This is an alternative to stackable cables. It is a PCB with only 3 TIPs and GND connected.
- It was not actually manufactured. There is no guarantee of operation at this time.
